<h1>Pictures and Codes are in folders DAY wise</h1>

<h3>DAY-1</h3>
- Learned about Akra Bazzi formula and many other ways to find time and space complexity of recurrence relations.

<h3>DAY-2</h3>
- Practiced Qs on finding time complexity of Iterative dependent and independent for loops and recurrence relations

<h3>DAY-3</h3>
- Started with recursion<br>
- Understood about recursion tree, base condition<br>
- Coded fibonacci number and binary search in recursion

<h3>DAY-4</h3>
- Practiced Basic Qs on recursion like pallindrome,print number from 1 to n / n to 1, factorial, count zeroes in a number, etc.

<h3>DAY-5</h3>
- Practiced Array Qs on recursion like :<br>
a) Whether the array is sorted<br>
b) Linear Search<br>
-> is the element in array<br>
-> find index from start<br>
-> find index from end<br>
-> find all the indexes<br>
c) Search in a rotated sorted array iteratively as well as recursively
